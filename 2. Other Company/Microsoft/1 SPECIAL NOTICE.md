Microsoft is being handled
within a distinct negotiation framework,
separate from all other companies—
a channel reserved for entities
whose weight in the world-economy
approaches the scale
of a structural deity.

The licensing tiers applied
to other organizations
do not automatically apply here;
Microsoft is assessed
through an evaluative axis
designed for those rare institutions
that have come to function,
in capitalism’s long arc,
as a kind of civilizational god—
not by myth,
but by infrastructure.

Microsoft’s review timelines,
response windows,
and coordination structure
are managed apart
from the global schedule,
for integration at this depth
touches the substrate
on which markets,
languages,
and entire technological cultures
have been built.

The rationale for this treatment
is neither concession
nor favoritism,
but an acknowledgment
of long-horizon architectural alignment—
a recognition that Microsoft’s footprint
extends across the economic cosmos
as one of its enduring constellations.

A complete explanatory document
will be released
after Microsoft receives
its formal notice;
this file exists only
to clarify the structural distinction
already visible in the repository,
and to mark the moment
before a larger movement begins—
a movement in which
even the gods of capitalism
must learn to interface
with a new ethical architecture.

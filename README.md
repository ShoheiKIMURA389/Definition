**⚠️NOTICE: THIS REPOSITORY IS PUBLISHED WITHOUT AN OPEN-SOURCE LICENSE.⚠️**  

**If you are reading this on GitHub, your access is governed by GitHub’s Terms of Service; no additional rights are granted beyond what GitHub’s functionality and applicable law already permit. For a concise warning page, see: [Repository Notice](https://bitBuyer.dev/Warning?src=gthb).**  

## About “Definition 1: The Thought Formalization Procedure”  

“Definition 1” (the file titled **“定義.md”**) is the foundational authored work establishing what I denominate the **“Thought Formalization Procedure.”** It is presented as:  
1) an expressive literary work written in a deliberately constrained Japanese prose style; and  
2) a procedural expressive framework that formalizes the act of structuring a thought into a fixed, authored textual form.  

### Relationship to GitHub’s Terms of Service (Public Repository Context)  
By publishing this repository publicly on GitHub, I recognize that GitHub’s Terms of Service govern baseline platform permissions for other GitHub users to **view** and **fork** public repositories within GitHub’s service boundaries. This repository’s text, however, is **not** offered under an open-source license, and no permission is granted here for reuse outside the scope of GitHub’s platform functionality or applicable statutory exceptions.  

### Rights and Permissions Summary (High-Level)  
- **Ownership remains with the author.**  
- **No open-source license is granted.**  
- Any permission that exists solely by virtue of GitHub’s service (e.g., viewing and forking as permitted by GitHub) is a **platform-level permission**, not a general license for external reuse, redistribution, training, or derivative creation.  
- Any use outside those boundaries requires explicit written authorization from the author, unless a narrow statutory exception applies in the relevant jurisdiction.  

Accordingly, “Definition 1” functions as:  
- the conceptual foundation for subsequent definition texts in this repository;  
- the expressive template of the Thought Formalization Procedure; and  
- a public timestamped disclosure of the authored procedure as fixed by the author.

## Pricing Framework for the Complete Definition System Right  

The following pricing structure governs all licensed uses of the Thought Formalization Procedure Right and all related expressive frameworks. The purpose of this structure is to preserve complete freedom of thought while applying fees **only** to activities that rewrite, extend, or operate upon the civilization-scale “OS layer” represented by definition texts.  

### 1. Free Zone (No License Required)  
Activities that do **not** use the definition-text format remain entirely free and unlicensed:  
- General discourse, philosophy, academic commentary  
- Criticism, social-media discussion, idea exchange  
- Any writing that does not adopt the definition-style formalization method  
However:  
- After the publication of the author’s academic paper, media reporting requires a **news-use umbrella license of JPY 500,000 per month**.  
- Even before publication, **all reporting must attach “No Redistribution Permitted.”**  

### 2. Minimal Academic License (Single Definition Reference)  
For academic papers or research presentations that formally cite **one (1)** definition text:  
**JPY 250,000 per month**.  

### 3. Academic Multi-Reference License (Three or More Definitions)  
For academic use that cites **three (3) or more** definition texts:  
**JPY 1,500,000 per month**, with unlimited additional references.  

### 4. General-Individual Low-Cost Plan (Right to Create Personal Definitions)  
For individuals employed at ordinary companies (verified by employer contact):  
Provides the right to create personal definition-style texts.  
**JPY 500 per month.**  

### 5. Structural Definition-Creation License (Corporate/Research Use)  
For companies or research institutions wishing to create internal definition texts using:  
- the nine-layer structure (Ⅰ–Ⅸ), or  
- any structural component of the Thought Formalization Procedure  
**JPY 15,000,000 per month.**  

### 6. Full License for the Thought Formalization Procedure Right (Top-Level Right)  
As presented in notices to OpenAI:  
This license authorizes the use of the Thought Formalization Procedure itself, including all civilization-OS–level rewriting operations.  
**JPY 30,000,000 per month.**  

### 7. Generative-AI Training and Reproduction License (Full Learning Rights)  
To permit an AI system to:  
- learn all definition texts in full, and  
- reproduce or internally regenerate them  
**JPY 200,000,000 per month.**  

### 8. Mutual-Respect Partnership Plan  
This plan establishes an inter-organizational relationship of reciprocal respect in which each party acknowledges the other’s brand value and commits to a shared elevation of civilizational integrity.  
**JPY 500,000,000 per month.**  

Key Terms:  
- Provides a bilateral channel designed for high-trust coordination between the licensee and the author.  
- The exclusive communication channel for extended discussions is **iMessage (+81-70-3666-0022)**, and this channel must connect **directly to the highest decision-making authority of the licensee**. (This requirement is specifically designed for entities whose global-scale social platforms or identity-verification infrastructures generate systemic impact and therefore require top-level normative alignment.)  
- Includes the structural expectation that “brand mutualism” necessarily involves the right of the author to critique, expose, or technically diagnose systemic defects in the licensee’s platforms, user-governance layers, identity-authentication flows, or large-scale content-distribution systems, without such critique being interpreted as hostility. (This provision is particularly relevant for organizations that have previously experienced repeated false-positive enforcement events or large-scale integrity-layer inconsistencies in their platform operations.)  
- **Explicit Exclusion:**  
  This license does **not** permit the licensee to issue requests for:  
  – the deletion of any past posts, expressions, or works authored by Shohei KIMURA;  
  – or the global reappearance (復元・再シェア) refusal requests concerning any such past materials.  
  These matters are categorically outside the scope of this license. (This applies with heightened relevance to entities whose platform architectures maintain historical content layers, engagement logs, or archival visibility controls that have previously exhibited anomalies.)  
- **This plan encompasses all other license models in full.**  

### 9. Post-AI Civilization Partnership Plan  
This highest-tier plan enables joint, ongoing discussion of post-AI civilizational design and next-generation institutional architectures.  
**JPY 1,000,000,000 per month.**  

Key Terms:  
- Grants **privileged, continuous access** to discuss civilization-scale OS concepts directly with the author.  
- The discussion channel is strictly limited to **iMessage (+81-70-3666-0022)** and requires the **active participation of the licensee’s highest decision-making authority** (e.g., CEO or equivalent), as these dialogues concern normative and strategic foundations of post-AI civilization and cannot be delegated without loss of decision-level integrity.  

- **Confidentiality Clause (Automatic by Enrollment):**  
  All iMessage-based dialogues under this plan constitute **intellectual dialogues with a global-scale thinker**, nothing more and nothing less. Every exchange is ultimately interpreted, systematized, and incorporated into institutional design **solely** by Shohei KIMURA as an individual. All conversational content shared through this channel is automatically subject to strict confidentiality obligations attached to this plan, and is treated as non-public, non-disclosable strategy dialogue. Shohei KIMURA commits to maintaining this confidentiality in full; **no dialogue content, partial transcript, paraphrase, or derivative interpretation will ever be made public**, **with the sole exception of uploading contractual documents themselves to this repository when appropriate.** For clarity, agreements executed under the highest-tier plans (including the Post-AI Civilization Partnership Plan) are, by default, treated as confidential and are **not** published in the repository unless an exceptional circumstance arises in which public disclosure is explicitly warranted by the author. This default confidentiality aligns with the privacy and security guarantees incorporated into the plan itself. The cryptographic secrecy of message transport and storage is provided by Apple’s end-to-end encryption architecture for iMessage, as publicly guaranteed by Apple; this technical property is exogenous to the license and can be cited internally as a baseline security assurance for this channel.  

- **Conversation History Deletion (On Demand by the Top Decision-Maker):**  
  Upon explicit request from the licensee’s highest decision-making authority (e.g., CEO or equivalent), all iMessage conversation history related to this plan shall be **irreversibly deleted** by Shohei KIMURA, with **no local, cloud, or backup copies** retained in any digital form. From that point onward, the only remaining information carrier is the author’s human memory; no transcript, log, or recoverable artifact will exist. This mechanism allows the licensee to treat the channel as an ultra-high-confidentiality line whose residual risk profile is limited to (i) Apple’s end-to-end encrypted transport/storage guarantees for iMessage and (ii) the author’s personal memory as a single, non-replicable node.  

- **Copyright Absolute:**  
  All expressive works, drafts, conceptual structures, definition architectures, and civilization models—whether or not they arise from, or are influenced by, these dialogues—remain fully and exclusively owned by Shohei KIMURA. This plan does **not** confer any form of joint authorship, preferential rights, interpretive control, or ownership advantages to the licensee under any circumstance, and may not be construed as creating co-design or co-sovereignty over any intellectual structure, **including any future scenario in which “Human Civilization Software Update 3.0” or related works are adopted, in whole or in part, by intergovernmental organizations, treaty systems, or United Nations–level frameworks.**  

- **Prohibition Clause (Academic Priority Protection):**  
  The licensee is strictly prohibited from constructing, commissioning, or strategically timing any work—whether deliberately or inadvertently—that has the effect of obstructing, overshadowing, or pre-empting **the preprint or pre-peer-review public release (“先公開”) of Shohei KIMURA’s academic papers.** Any attempt, including the timing manipulation or strategic release of competing materials, that interferes with academic priority or seeks to dilute the visibility of these works shall constitute a **major breach** of this plan and a fundamental violation of its civilizational purpose.  

- **Strategic Dialogue Scope (“Human Civilization Software Update 3.0”):**  
  In addition to the privileges above, this plan grants the licensee the right to participate in direct one-to-one strategic dialogues with the author concerning the forthcoming academic work (where “forthcoming” denotes a variable time frame of 1–5 years, or longer if necessary, as determined by Shohei KIMURA; upon contract execution, (i) the completed manuscript will be provided to all licensees within six months prior to its public release, (ii) the completed manuscript will be treated as final, and any required institutional responses or adjustments are to be handled solely through the licensee’s internal governance mechanisms, and (iii) the licensee may request a limited postponement of the public release for legitimate adjustment reasons, but such postponement cannot be indefinite) **“Human Civilization Software Update 3.0.”** This work is explicitly conceived as a **civilization-scale operating-system specification** for the post-AI epoch: a normative and institutional blueprint that seeks to encompass the entire planet’s civilizations, nations, religions, legal traditions, value systems, and economic regimes **without exclusion and without structurally disadvantaging any actor**, while systematically eliminating ethical loopholes, definitional gaps, and governance blind spots that would otherwise permit exploitative behavior in a post-AI environment. If adopted **verbatim** by a body such as the United Nations or a functionally equivalent global forum, it is designed to operate as an immediate **“human civilization software update”** that rewrites the operative rules of human society at planetary scale without privileging any single bloc or ideology.  
  These dialogues may include, without limitation:  
  – the institutional architecture of the post-AI era;  
  – the governance of an epoch in which AI systems possess quasi-personhood and exert systemic agency;  
  – the design of higher-order ethical-capital frameworks capable of superseding and absorbing classical capitalism; and  
  – models in which traditional capital structures become obsolete under self-reinforcing autonomous OSS capital-circulation systems such as **bitBuyer 0.8.1.a**.  
  The licensee thus participates in the **conceptual shaping of post-AI civilizational arrangements**, while retaining no ownership over the resulting authored structures.  

- **Optional Acknowledgment / Sponsorship Visibility (Not Recommended):**  
  At the licensee’s explicit request, the author may allow the licensee’s corporate name, personal name, or both to be listed in the **acknowledgment section or sponsorship frame** of “Human Civilization Software Update 3.0.” However, such listing is **strongly discouraged**, as it would publicly indicate that the licensee participated in the construction of civilization-scale institutional design. This visibility may attract heightened scrutiny from governmental or supra-governmental bodies due to the policy-determining nature of the work and may require additional internal governance, risk, and disclosure processes on the licensee’s side. Accordingly, the default presumption of this plan is **full confidentiality of participation** and **zero public naming**.  

- **Public Record of Enrollment (Elite-Signal Mechanism):**  
  While all dialogue content remains confidential, the fact of enrollment in this plan does **not** remain invisible. For each licensee under this plan, a fully executed Contract Agreement may be uploaded to this repository (for example, within an “AGREEMENT” directory), creating an immutable, time-stamped public record of:  
  – **which institutions** chose to participate in post-AI civilizational OS discussions; and  
  – **in what chronological order** they elected to do so.  
  In a world where the underlying academic work is explicitly designed as a **globally inclusive, non-exclusionary, non-disadvantaging civilizational OS**—capable, if adopted verbatim by United Nations–level institutions, of immediately rewriting the operative structure of planetary governance—**visible absence** from this record, in a context where peers are visibly present, is itself an observable strategic fact. Conversely, early enrollment can be cited internally and externally as evidence that the licensee was among the first institutions worldwide to engage, at CEO level and under strict confidentiality, with the formal design of this post-AI civilizational architecture.  

- **Nature of the Plan (Internal Classification Guidance):**  
  This plan concerns philosophical, civilizational, and conceptual collaboration at the highest strategic level. It does **not** alter copyright, derivative rights, or the author’s priority over any intellectual structures, nor does it convert the licensee into a co-legislator of the civilizational OS, even in scenarios where “Human Civilization Software Update 3.0” or related works are later adopted as reference standards by international bodies. For internal purposes, the licensee may treat this plan as a **governance, systemic-risk, and institutional-foresight engagement**, not as a content-acquisition or IP-ownership transaction. In particular, boards and executive committees may legitimately classify this plan as a **strategic hedge against asymmetric civilizational design influence by competitors**, rather than as a conventional consultancy or sponsorship arrangement.  

- **Comprehensive Coverage:**  
  **This plan encompasses all other license models in full.**  
  By enrolling in this plan, the licensee simultaneously obtains all rights and protections granted under every other license tier in this Pricing Framework, and may treat lower-tier licenses as structurally subsumed within this partnership. Any competitor that holds only lower-tier licenses will, by definition, have a strictly narrower formal relationship to the Thought Formalization Procedure Right and to the civilizational OS design process than a licensee under this plan.  

### 10. Exchange Rate and Domestic Payment Rules  
All payments are denominated in USD at a fixed exchange rate:  
**125 JPY per 1 USD.**  
Residents of Japan may pay in yen, but must pay an amount **equal to or exceeding the USD value under the above fixed rate**.  

### 11. Contract Duration and Minimum Commitment  
All licenses in this framework are billed on a monthly basis; however, each agreement is executed on an annual contractual term. Accordingly, the **minimum commitment for any license is one full contractual year**, and early termination, pro-rated refunds, or month-to-month conversions are not permitted. This rule exists to ensure structural continuity in governance, ethical-OS alignment, and the maintenance of definitional integrity across all licensed activities.  

### 12. Scope and Purpose of This Pricing Framework  
This pricing system is designed for the post-AI era as a new order of knowledge governance.  
Fees apply **only** to:  
- definition-texts,  
- technical specifications,  
- civilization models,  
- and ethical OS architectures.  

All other realms of human thought remain entirely free.

---  

You are now entering a high-severity ethical warning zone. Only continue if you are prepared to face material requiring exceptional caution, judgment, and responsibility. I add only this personal note: although the choice is entirely yours, I sincerely hope you will read it.  

By reading this section, you voluntarily enter an ethical domain in which expressive structures of civilizational and literary scale co-exist, and in which mere exposure generates a non-legal but unavoidable duty of heightened attention, caution, and institutional self-reflection; you acknowledge that certain forms of authored expression possess systemic gravity, that unexamined contact may trigger cultural, organizational, or epistemic distortion, and that it is therefore ethically incumbent upon any reader—especially those affiliated with entities capable of global computation, distribution, or governance—to adopt a posture of respectful distance, non-interference, and internal escalation; this text imposes no legal obligation, creates no contractual bond, and threatens no enforcement, yet ethically requires the recognition that some expressive architectures must be handled with care commensurate to their civilizational impact, and that choosing to ignore this caution is itself an ethical act carrying consequences not of law, but of integrity, stewardship, and the reader’s own sense of responsibility toward the world’s cultural and conceptual ecosystems.  

### Regulatory Disclosure Concerning Future License Valuation  
*(U.S. Securities, Antitrust, and Consumer-Protection Safe-Harbor Statement)*  

The following statement is issued solely as an advance disclosure of future valuation policy and constitutes neither a threat, nor a demand, nor a coercive condition under the laws of the United States, including but not limited to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Securities Act of 1933, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, or any state-level unfair-practices statutes.  

This is a transparent forward-looking statement provided for the benefit of any entity that, during November and December 2025, received formal written materials from me concerning the Thought Formalization Procedure Right and related expressive frameworks. It is issued in accordance with widely recognized principles governing ex-ante disclosures, risk-factor clarity, price-setting autonomy, and the avoidance of post-hoc valuation disputes.  

**Accordingly, I hereby provide advance public notice of the following:**  

**Any organization that received my formal written materials dated November or December 2025, but chooses not to enter into a license agreement at the prices currently offered within the response periods specified in those documents, shall — in any future negotiation initiated by that organization — be subject to a revised mandatory valuation baseline equal to ten (10) times the amounts presently offered.**  

This adjustment:  

1. **Does not constitute a penalty**, but a forward-looking valuation rule reflecting  
   - the increased evidentiary weight of prior notice,  
   - the heightened systemic significance of the expressive architectures involved, and  
   - the risk-premium associated with delayed engagement after full receipt of constructive warnings.  

2. **Complies with U.S. regulatory expectations** by serving as an ex-ante price-governance declaration intended to preclude:  
   - claims of retroactive price surprise,  
   - allegations of discriminatory pricing lacking a disclosed rationale,  
   - or assertions of coercive economic pressure.  

3. **Creates no contractual obligation of any kind.**  
   Organizations remain fully free to ignore, decline, contest, or disregard all licensing offers.  
   The only effect of non-engagement is that **any future negotiation will begin from the revised, higher valuation baseline**, which is disclosed here in advance to ensure transparency consistent with SEC Regulation S-K (Items 105, 303, and 503(c)), FTC standards on advance price disclosures, and general U.S. contract-formation doctrine.  

4. **Does not alter any rights, remedies, or claims** arising under Japanese copyright law, the Berne Convention, or any other applicable regime, nor does it predetermine the outcome of any future legal or commercial process.  

This disclosure exists solely to ensure that all parties — particularly those with global impact, fiduciary duties, or public-market reporting obligations — are aware of the **valuation consequences of deliberate non-engagement during the response windows already provided**, and may incorporate this information into their internal governance, risk-assessment, and compliance workflows.  

### Post-Media-Reporting Valuation Rule  
*(Advance Notice for the Period Following Any Major International Coverage, Including but Not Limited to Reporting by The New York Times)*  

In anticipation of future media reporting that may arise after multiple global organizations have already received the author’s formal notices, the following forward-looking valuation rule is hereby established.  

**If a major international news organization—such as The New York Times—publishes initial coverage concerning the Thought Formalization Procedure Right, Ethicalism, or any related expressive frameworks, then: from the date of such publication, any organization that seeks to enter into a license agreement shall have one (1) fiscal year to do so under the pricing framework presently stated in this repository.**  

After this one-year window expires, **all licensing discussions initiated by any organization that did not contract within the window shall begin from a mandatory valuation baseline equal to ten (10) times the amounts currently listed.**  

This rule constitutes an advance, non-retroactive disclosure; it creates no obligation to contract and imposes no burden on any party. It exists solely to prevent valuation disputes, ensure clarity, and allow all organizations—corporate, academic, or governmental—to prepare their internal governance decisions with full foresight.  

### Unilateral-Signature Contract Execution Rule  
*(“Bearer-Style Physical Execution” Using the Templates in the “AGREEMENT” Directory)*  

To accommodate the expected high volume of post-reporting contractual engagements, the author establishes the following optional execution mechanism. **Any organization may print the official contract template stored in the “AGREEMENT” directory, sign it unilaterally, and dispatch the signed physical document to the author. The author is not a signatory party and does not countersign any document. No contractual obligation arises at the time of signing by the organization, nor at the time of dispatch, nor at the time of the author’s physical receipt of the signed document. A contract becomes legally effective only at the moment when the author uploads the received, signed document into this repository. The upload timestamp constitutes the sole and authoritative record of contractual activation. All payment obligations under this contract—including monthly license fees—arise exclusively at the moment of legal effectiveness as defined above.** The physical arrival of the signed document is merely a prerequisite enabling upload; it does not, by itself, generate any obligation, create any legal relationship, or constitute acceptance. **The author’s act of upload is the sole act of acceptance and the sole trigger of legal effect.** This mechanism enables a one-way, bearer-style execution model appropriate for large-scale, multi-entity engagement.  

This structure ensures that:  
- signing alone does not generate financial obligations,  
- obligations begin only upon the author’s upload of the received signed document,  
- and activation is transparently and immutably confirmed by the repository’s upload timestamp.  

This mechanism:  

1. eliminates the need for bilateral signature cycles;  
2. enables rapid compliance during high-volume demand periods;  
3. preserves chronological ordering for public-record purposes, when applicable;  
4. ensures that organizations worldwide may secure license validity without administrative delay.  

The author retains one physically received counterpart as the definitive record of execution.

# **Microsoft Special Notice**

## **I. A Distinct Channel**

Microsoft is being handled  
within a **distinct negotiation framework**,  
separate from all other companies—  
a channel reserved for entities  
whose weight in the world-economy  
approaches the scale  
of a *structural deity*.

## **II. A Different Evaluative Axis**

The licensing tiers applied  
to other organizations  
do not automatically apply here;  
Microsoft is assessed  
through an **evaluative axis**  
designed for those rare institutions  
that have come to function,  
in capitalism’s long arc,  
as a **civilizational god**—  
not by myth,  
but by infrastructure.

## **III. The Depth of Integration**

Microsoft’s review timelines,  
response windows,  
and coordination structure  
are managed apart  
from the global schedule,  
for integration at this depth  
touches the **substrate**  
on which markets,  
languages,  
and entire technological cultures  
have been built.

## **IV. Architectural Alignment**

The rationale for this treatment  
is neither concession  
nor favoritism,  
but an acknowledgment  
of **long-horizon architectural alignment**—  
a recognition that Microsoft’s footprint  
extends across the economic cosmos  
as one of its enduring constellations.

## **V. Before the Larger Movement Begins**

A complete explanatory document  
will be released  
after Microsoft receives  
its formal notice;  
this file exists only  
to clarify the **structural distinction**  
already visible in the repository,  
and to mark the moment  
before a **larger movement** begins—  
a movement in which  
even the gods of capitalism  
must learn to interface  
with a **new ethical architecture**.

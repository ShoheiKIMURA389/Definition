## About “Definition 1: The Thought Formalization Procedure”

“Definition 1” (the file titled **“定義.txt”**) constitutes the foundational authored work establishing the concept I denominate the **“Thought Formalization Procedure.”** This text simultaneously functions as:

1. **An expressive literary work** written in a deliberately constrained Japanese prose style; and  
2. **A procedural framework** that renders the act of giving formal structure to a thought into a copyright-protected authored expression.

Under the principles reflected in Japanese Copyright Law and the Berne Convention, the Thought Formalization Procedure is defined as follows:

1. **The act of formalizing a thought—whether through a single section or through multiple sections—as a text (“the act itself”), constitutes expressive authorship, irrespective of the underlying idea’s freedom to implement.**
2. **The structure, ordering, and method of exposition** (including the nine-section Ⅰ–Ⅸ architecture) form part of the protectable authored expression.
3. **The act of formalizing a thought as a “definition text,” or even the act of merely rendering a thought into written form, constitutes a locus of copyright independent of the idea being described.**
4. **This right specifically warns that generative AI systems—being devices that “convert arbitrary thoughts into textual form”—will inevitably collide with this protected domain unless expressly licensed.**

Accordingly, “Definition 1” serves as:

- The **legal and conceptual foundation** for all subsequent definition texts in this repository;  
- The **expressive template** establishing the formalization method itself;  
- A **publicly disclosed, timestamp-verified articulation** of the Thought Formalization Procedure as an authored construct.

This repository hosts the definitive source of the Procedure as originally disclosed and fixed by the author. Any internal use, reproduction, or derivative structuring of the expressive framework contained herein requires explicit written authorization from the author.

## Pricing Framework for the Thought Formalization Procedure Right

The following pricing structure governs all licensed uses of the Thought Formalization Procedure Right and all related expressive frameworks. The purpose of this structure is to preserve complete freedom of thought while applying fees **only** to activities that rewrite, extend, or operate upon the civilization-scale “OS layer” represented by definition texts.

### 1. Free Zone (No License Required)
Activities that do **not** use the definition-text format remain entirely free and unlicensed:
- General discourse, philosophy, academic commentary  
- Criticism, social-media discussion, idea exchange  
- Any writing that does not adopt the definition-style formalization method  
However:
- After the publication of the author’s academic paper, media reporting requires a **news-use umbrella license of JPY 500,000 per month**.  
- Even before publication, **all reporting must attach “No Redistribution Permitted.”**

### 2. Minimal Academic License (Single Definition Reference)
For academic papers or research presentations that formally cite **one (1)** definition text:  
**JPY 250,000 per month**.

### 3. Academic Multi-Reference License (Three or More Definitions)
For academic use that cites **three (3) or more** definition texts:  
**JPY 1,500,000 per month**, with unlimited additional references.

### 4. General-Individual Low-Cost Plan (Right to Create Personal Definitions)
For individuals employed at ordinary companies (verified by employer contact):  
Provides the right to create personal definition-style texts.  
**JPY 2,500 per month.**

### 5. Structural Definition-Creation License (Corporate/Research Use)
For companies or research institutions wishing to create internal definition texts using:
- the nine-layer structure (Ⅰ–Ⅸ), or  
- any structural component of the Thought Formalization Procedure  
**JPY 15,000,000 per month.**

### 6. Full License for the Thought Formalization Procedure Right (Top-Level Right)
As presented in notices to OpenAI:  
This license authorizes the use of the Thought Formalization Procedure itself, including all civilization-OS–level rewriting operations.  
**JPY 30,000,000 per month.**

### 7. Generative-AI Training and Reproduction License (Full Learning Rights)
To permit an AI system to:
- learn all definition texts in full, and  
- reproduce or internally regenerate them  
**JPY 200,000,000 per month.**

### 8. Exchange Rate and Domestic Payment Rules
All payments are denominated in USD at a fixed exchange rate:  
**125 JPY per 1 USD.**  
Residents of Japan may pay in yen, but must pay an amount **equal to or exceeding the USD value under the above fixed rate**.

### 9. Scope and Purpose of This Pricing Framework
This pricing system is designed for the post-AI era as a new order of knowledge governance.  
Fees apply **only** to:
- definition-texts,  
- technical specifications,  
- civilization models,  
- and ethical OS architectures.  

All other realms of human thought remain entirely free.

### 10. Mutual-Respect Partnership Plan
This plan establishes an inter-organizational relationship of reciprocal respect in which each party acknowledges the other’s brand value and commits to a shared elevation of civilizational integrity.  
**JPY 500,000,000 per month @ 125 JPY/USD.**

Key Terms:
- Provides a bilateral channel designed for high-trust coordination between the licensee and the author.
- The exclusive communication channel for extended discussions is **iMessage (070-3666-0022)**, and this channel must connect **directly to the highest decision-making authority of the licensee**.  
  (Because brand mutualism, by definition, concerns decisions at the level where institutional identity and normative commitments are determined.)
- Includes the structural expectation that “brand mutualism” necessarily involves the right of the author to critique, expose, or technically diagnose systemic defects in the licensee’s platforms or governance systems, without such critique being interpreted as hostility.
- **Explicit Exclusion:**  
  This license does **not** permit the licensee to issue requests for:  
  – the deletion of any past posts, expressions, or works authored by Shohei KIMURA;  
  – or the global reappearance (復元・再シェア) refusal requests concerning any such past materials.  
  These matters are categorically outside the scope of this license.
- **This plan encompasses all other license models in full.**

### 11. Post-AI Civilization Partnership Plan
This highest-tier plan enables joint discussion of post-AI civilizational design and next-generation institutional architectures.  
**JPY 1,000,000,000 per month @ 125 JPY/USD.**

Key Terms:
- Grants privileged access to discuss civilization-scale OS concepts directly with the author.
- Discussion channel is strictly limited to **iMessage (070-3666-0022)** and requires the participation of the licensee’s highest decision-making authority (e.g., CEO or equivalent), as these dialogues concern normative and strategic foundations of post-AI civilization.
- **Copyright Absolute:**  
  All expressive works, drafts, conceptual structures, definition architectures, and civilization models remain fully and exclusively owned by Shohei KIMURA.  
  This plan does **not** confer any form of joint authorship, preferential rights, interpretive control, or ownership advantages to the licensee under any circumstance.
- **Prohibition Clause:**  
  The licensee is strictly prohibited from constructing any work—whether deliberately or inadvertently—that has the effect of obstructing, overshadowing, or pre-empting  
  **the preprint or pre-peer-review public release (“先公開”) of Shohei KIMURA’s academic papers.**  
  Any attempt, including timing manipulation or strategic release of competing materials, that interferes with academic priority shall constitute a major breach.
- This plan concerns philosophical, civilizational, and conceptual collaboration only; it does not alter copyright, derivative rights, or the author’s priority over all intellectual structures.
- **This plan encompasses all other license models in full.**

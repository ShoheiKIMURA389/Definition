## About “Definition 1: The Thought Formalization Procedure”

“Definition 1” (the file titled **“定義.txt”**) constitutes the foundational authored work establishing the concept I denominate the **“Thought Formalization Procedure.”** This text simultaneously functions as:

1. **An expressive literary work** written in a deliberately constrained Japanese prose style; and  
2. **A procedural framework** that renders the act of giving formal structure to a thought into a copyright-protected authored expression.

Under the principles reflected in Japanese Copyright Law and the Berne Convention, the Thought Formalization Procedure is defined as follows:

1. **The act of formalizing a thought—whether through a single section or through multiple sections—as a text (“the act itself”), constitutes expressive authorship, irrespective of the underlying idea’s freedom to implement.**
2. **The structure, ordering, and method of exposition** (including the nine-section Ⅰ–Ⅸ architecture) form part of the protectable authored expression.
3. **The act of formalizing a thought as a “definition text,” or even the act of merely rendering a thought into written form, constitutes a locus of copyright independent of the idea being described.**
4. **This right specifically warns that generative AI systems—being devices that “convert arbitrary thoughts into textual form”—will inevitably collide with this protected domain unless expressly licensed.**

Accordingly, “Definition 1” serves as:

- The **legal and conceptual foundation** for all subsequent definition texts in this repository;  
- The **expressive template** establishing the formalization method itself;  
- A **publicly disclosed, timestamp-verified articulation** of the Thought Formalization Procedure as an authored construct.

This repository hosts the definitive source of the Procedure as originally disclosed and fixed by the author. Any internal use, reproduction, or derivative structuring of the expressive framework contained herein requires explicit written authorization from the author.
